## About
I am a second year PhD Track candidate at [Institut Polytechnique de Paris](https://www.ip-paris.fr/en). My work focuses on acoustic signal processing, generative modelling, optimisation and deep learning. On this site, you can find my recent works and I am in the progress of arranging projects and codes.  

I am currently working as an intern at [LTCI](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/fr/recherche/labos/traitement-information-ltci), [Télécom Pari](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/). And the current subject of my study is Guided Optimal trajectory descent within an alpha-stable model.
